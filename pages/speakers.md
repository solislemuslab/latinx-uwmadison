Title: Early Rot of Cranberry: Evaluating grower concerns and Phyllosticta vaccinii presence in vegetatively propagated cuttings

Bio: Ana Maria is a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. She studies how current management of cranberry cuttings impacts pathogen incidence and movement, especially those involved the cranberry fruit rot complex. Her previous research includes addressing grower-oriented questions through the study of tomato and potato plant microbiome with a focus in bacterial endophytes, understanding how biotic and abiotic factors impact plant productivity and product quality and assessing these factors by conducting greenhouse and field studies. When not in the lab, she enjoys cooking, dancing and going to live shows.

## Marcela Tabima Martinez (Regenerative Biology Research Group)
