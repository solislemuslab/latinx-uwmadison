            Dr. Ana Maria Porras (she/her) is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Florida, where she leads the Tissue-Microbe Interactions lab. Her group engineers models of disease to study human-microbe interactions in the contexts of the gut microbiome, global health, and neglected tropical diseases. She is also a science artist and an expert on inclusive bilingual science communication. Dr. Porras is the co-founder and Senior Advisor of the Latinx in Biomedical Engineering community. She was selected as an IF/THEN AAAS Ambassador for girls and women in STEM and was honored with a statue at the Smithsonian Institution within that program.  Prior to arriving in Florida, Dr. Porras was a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Cornell University. She holds a B.S. in biomedical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, and a Masters and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she was also an American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellow. When she isnâ€™t doing all that, she loves to read, dance, travel, and, above all, eat ice cream.
